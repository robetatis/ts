# Seasonal ARIMA models
# ****************************************

# there's a clear repetitive pattern every S time periods

# in seasonal ARIMA, there's seasonal AR and MA terms that use x_t and w_t at lag
# values that are multiples of S

# examples:
#   - x_tminus12 in a seasonal AR(1) model (time unit 1 month)
#   - x_tminus12 and x_tminus24 in a seasonal AR(2) (time unit 1 month)


# seasonal differencing:

# seasonality causes instationarity. e.g., distribution parameters in summer will
# not be the same as in winter 
# -> formulas for E(x_t), Var(x_t), etc. break down!

# with backshift operator: x_t - x_tminus12 = (1 - B^12)*x_t

# we may need both de-trending and seasonal differencing:
# (1-B^12)(1-B)*x_t = (x_t - x_tminus1) - (x_tminus12 - x_tminus13)
# what this does is 'break down' variation in x_t into trend and seasonality, i.e., 
# into short-term and long-term effects

# the model:

# ARIMA(p,d,q,) x (P, D, Q)S; where p, d, q = non-seasonal orders; P, D, Q = seasonal
# orders

# (1)PHI(B^S)*phi(B)(x_t - miu) = THETA(B^S)*theta(B)*w_t
# seasonal_AR x non-seasonal_AR = seasonal_MA x non-seasonal_MA

# non-seasonal components:
#   - AR: phi(B) = 1 - phi_1*B - ... - phi_p*B^p
#   - MA: theta(B) = 1 + theta_1*B + ... theta_q*B^q
# seasonal components:
#   - AR_S: PHI(B^S) = 1 - PHI_1*B^S - ... - PHI_P*B^PS
#   - MA_S: THETA(B^S) = 1 + THETA_1*B^S + ... + THETA_Q*B^QS
# PS = P times S, i.e., a multiple of S. Same for Q (the no. of seasons backwards)


# example: ARIMA(0, 0, 1) x (0, 0, 1)12 
#   -> terms: 1 non-sesaonal MA, 1 seasonal MA, seasonality = 12 t units
# model: x_t - miu = THETA(B^12)*theta(B)*w_t   (no AR terms)
# x_t - miu = (1 + THETA_1*B^12)(1 + theta_1*B)*w_t
# x_t - miu = (1 + theta_1*B + THETA_1*B^12 + THETA_1*theta_1*B^13)*w_t
# x_t - miu = w_t + theta_1*w_tminus1 + THETA_1*w_tminus12 + THETA_1*theta_1*w_tminus13

# generate synthetic data
x_t <- as.numeric(astsa::sarima.sim(ma=0.7, sma=0.6, S=12, n=1000)) + 10

# check data, ACF and PACF
par(mfcol=c(1, 3))
plot(x_t, type='o', pch=20)
acf(x_t, xlim=c(1, 40), ylim=c(-1, 1), main='ACF')
pacf(x_t, xlim=c(1, 40), ylim=c(-1, 1), main='PACF')

# ACF:
#   - significant lags at 1, 12 and 13, as expected. 
#   - strangely, there's also significant spike at lag 11
#   - slightly larger ACF again at lag 24, i.e., at lag 2*S (S=12)

# PACF:
#   - 'seasonal' tapering -> tapering (with alternating signs) first after
#      lag 1, and then again after lag 11, then again after lag 24 
#      i.e., at multiples of S

# fit model
x_t_hat <- astsa::sarima(x_t, p=0, d=0, q=1, Q=1, S=12)
print(x_t_hat)


# another example: ARIMA(1, 0, 0) x (1, 0, 0)12
#   -> terms: 1 non-sesaonal AR, 1 seasonal AR, seasonality = 12 t units
# model: PHI(B^12)phi(B)(x_t - miu) = w_t
# setting x_t - miu = z_t:
# (1 - PHI_1(B^12))(1 - phi_1(B))(z_t) = w_t
# (1 - phi_1(B) - PHI_1(B^12) + PHI_1*phi_1(B^13))(z_t) = w_t
# z_t = phi_1*z_tminus1 + PHI_1*z_tminus12 - PHI_1*phi_1*z_tminus13 + w_t

x_t <- as.numeric(astsa::sarima.sim(ar=0.6, sar=-0.5, S=12, n=1000))

par(mfcol=c(1, 3))
plot(x_t, type='o', pch=20)
acf(x_t, xlim=c(1, 40), ylim=c(-1, 1), main='ACF')
pacf(x_t, xlim=c(1, 40), ylim=c(-1, 1), main='PACF')

# ACF:
#   - seasonal tapering, autocorrelation starts positive at lag 1, then tapers
#     and starts having negative values towards lag 12

# PACF:
#   - peaks at lags 1, 12 and 13, and also 11


# ****************************************
# identifying a seasonal model
# ****************************************

# 1. plot raw data, search for trend and seasonality
# 2. ACF and PACF for raw data:
#    depending on whether there's AR and/or MA terms, ACF or PACF will show seasonality
#    gradual oscillations with peaks at multiples of S
#    if AR, PACF will show significant peaks only at relevant lags, ACF will taper seasonally
#    if MA, ACF will show significant peaks only at relevant lags, PACF will taper seasonally
# 3. do necessary differencing, seasonal and non-seasonal. look again at ACF, PACF



# example ACF and PACF before/after seasonal differencing:
x_t <- as.numeric(astsa::sarima.sim(ar=0.6, sar=-0.5, S=12, n=1000))

par(mfcol=c(1, 3))
plot(x_t, type='o', pch=20)
acf(x_t, xlim=c(1, 40), ylim=c(-1, 1), main='ACF')
pacf(x_t, xlim=c(1, 40), ylim=c(-1, 1), main='PACF')

# in time series analysis, data are not necessarily independent and not necessarily
# iid

# first look: trend, seasonality (-> calendar time has effect), long-run cycle, 
# sigma = const, outliers, abrupt breaks in mean or variance

# example: annual earthquake series
library(dplyr)
earthquakes <- read.table(
  file = 'earthquakes.csv',
  header = TRUE,
  sep = ','
  )
earthquakes$Date <- as.Date(earthquakes$Date, format='%m/%d/%Y')
earthquakes$Year <- format(earthquakes$Date, format='%Y')
earthquakes %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  count() -> earthquakes_by_year
par(mfcol = c(1, 3))
plot(earthquakes_by_year$Year, earthquakes_by_year$n, type='o', pch=20)
abline(h=mean(earthquakes_by_year$n))

# features of the series:
#   - upward trend
#   - no clear seasonality
#   - maybe 1 outlier in 2011 (712 earthquakes)
#   - more erratic towards right side, perhaps variance is higher there

# example: the AR(1) model:
# x_t = delta + phi_1*x_tminus1 + w_t
# assumptions:
#   - w_t --> iid N(0, sigma_w^2)
#   - w_t independent of x

# lag-1 plot
n <- nrow(earthquakes_by_year)
x_t <- earthquakes_by_year$n[2:n]
x_tminus1 <- earthquakes_by_year$n[1:(n-1)]
plot(x_tminus1, x_t)

# assuming we can just use OLS on x_t ~ x_tminus1 (for different reasons this is 
# not correct, discussed below), we'd do this:
ols <- lm(x_t ~ x_tminus1)
summary(ols)
abline(ols)

# OLS results 
# model: x_t = 141.5 + 0.672 * x_tminus1, F(1, 50) = 22.81, p<0.001
# residual standard error = 91.4
# slope is significant, so lag1 variable is useful
# R^2 = 0.29
# residual analysis:
plot(ols$fitted.values, ols$residuals)
abline(h=0)
# there's a two major outliers at fitted values ~460 (low leverage) and ~700 

# example with trend and seasonality: quarterly beer production in australia
library(fpp)
data(ausbeer)
ausbeer <- data.frame(
  t = as.numeric(time(ausbeer))[1:72],
  tsquared = as.numeric(time(ausbeer))[1:72]^2,
  quarter = cycle(ausbeer)[1:72],
  x_t = as.numeric(ausbeer)[1:72]
)

# features of the series:
#   - clear upward trend
#   - clear seasonality, with values increasing from Q2 to Q4 and then going back 
#     down
#   - 1 outliers at end of series
#   - variance seems slightly larger toward end of series

# one could manually devise a model based on classical regression, and try
# to reproduce with it the observed trend and seasonality:
#   - for linear trend, use t as predictor, t + t^2 for quadratic trend
#   - for quarterly seasonality, we can define indicator variables Sj, where
#     j = 1, 2, 3, 4 (the quarters) and Sj = 1 if value is in quarter j, 0 otherwise
#   - model: x_t = beta1*t + beta2*t^2 + alpha1*S1 + alpha2*S2 + alpha3*S3 + alpha4*S4 + w_t

# create Sj
for(j in 1:4){ 
  varname <- paste0('S', j)

i_train <- 1:50

ausbeer_test <- ausbeer[i_test, ]

# fit model

# ********************
# stationarity
# *******************

# related to how distribution of stochastic process {X_t}, and its mean, variance 
# and covariance at a particular lag, vary over time

# strict/strong stationarity: 
#   - distribution of stochastic process {Xt} does not change in time
#   - variance may be infinite!

# weak stationarity: 
#   - mean, variance and autocorrelation do not change in time; the actual shape 
#     of the distribution may change
#   - variance must be finite!

# relation strong / weak stationarity:
#   - if it weren't for the infinite variance, strong would imply weak, but weakly
#     stationary series must have finite variance
#   - obviously, weak does NOT imply strong, since distribution may change while
#     mean, variance and autocorrelation stay the same



# ********************
# The AR(1) model
# *******************

# x_t = delta + phi_1*x_tminus1 + w_t

# assumptions:
#   - x_t weakly stationary
#   - w_t --> iid N(0, sigma_w^2)
#   - w_t independent of x

# properties:
#   - expected value E(x_t):
#     E(x_t) = E(delta + phi_1*x_tminus1 + w_t)
#     E(x_t) = E(delta) + E(phi_1*x_tminus1) + E(w_t)
#     E(x_t) = delta + phi_1*E(x_tminus1) + 0 
#     Due to stationarity, E(x_t) = E(x_tminus1), which we can call miu. Then,
#     miu = delta / (1 - phi_1)
#
#   - variance Var(x_t):
#     Var(x_t) = Var(delta + phi_1*x_tminus1 + w_t)
#     ...assuming x_t and w_t (errors) are independent, and noting that delta and
#        phi_1 are constants:
#     Var(x_t) = 0 + Var(phi_1*x_tminus1) + Var(w_t)
#     Var(x_t) = phi_1^2*Var(x_tminus1) + sigma_w^2
#     ...assuming series is stationary, Var(x_t) = Var(x_tminus1)
#     Var(x_t) = sigma_w^2 / (1 - phi_1^2)
#
#   - lag-1 autocorrelation = phi_h
#
# ACF patterns with phi_1 > 0 and phi_1 < 0:

# set parameters
delta <- 20
phi_1_pos <- 0.6
phi_1_neg <- -0.6
n <- 50

# initialize series
x_pos <- double(length = n)
x_neg <- double(length = n)
x_pos[1] <- runif(1, min=0, max=10)

# compute series
for(i in seq(2, n, by=1)){
  x_pos[i] <- delta + phi_1_pos*x_pos[i-1] + rnorm(n=1, mean=0, sd=10)

# for phi_1 > 0, ACF tapers towards 0 relatively quickly
# for phi_1 > 0, same happens, but more slowly and with alternating sign for ACF

# theoretically, for an AR(1) process, the phi for higher lags should be the 
# successive powers of phi_1

# for non-stationary data, use 1-order differencing to stabilize series
